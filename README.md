## Course Description

<p>Geospatial data science is booming right now, and its appeal isnâ€™t limited to just a few select fields. Its applications in the real world run the gamut, proving its utility in a wide range of industries, including aerospace, agriculture, urban planning, and tech. In this hands-on interactive course, instructor Maggie Ma provides an overview of how to perform advanced Spatial SQL operations in a local database. Maggie shows you how to set up a local DBeaver pgAdmin 4 database, import public datasets, and run PostGIS SQL queries to execute spatial joins. This course is ideal for database administrators and data scientists looking to learn more about the value of geospatial data.</p><p>This course is integrated with GitHub Codespaces, an instant cloud developer environment that offers all the functionality of your favorite IDE without the need for any local machine setup. With GitHub Codespaces, you can get hands-on practice from any machine, at any time-all while using a tool that you'll likely encounter in the workplace. Check out the "Using GitHub Codespaces with this course" video to learn how to get started.</p>
